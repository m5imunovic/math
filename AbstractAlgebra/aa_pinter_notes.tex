\section{Notes to me}
\begin{itemize}
        \item Set can be anything, not limited to numbers.
        \item Remember that sets might contain infinite number of members.
\end{itemize}
\section{Operations}
An operation $*$ on $A$ is a rule which assigns to each ordered pair $(a,b)$ of elements of A exactly one element $a * b$ in A.
\begin{definition}{}
        \textnormal{$a * b$ is defined for \textbf{every} ordered pair $(a, b)$ of elements of $A$.}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{}
        \textnormal{$a * b$ must be \textbf{uniquely} defined.}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{}
        \textnormal{If $a$ and $b$ are in $A$, $a * b$ must be in $A$.}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{}
        \textnormal{Operation is \textit{commutative} if $a * b = b * a$ for any $a$ and $b$ in $A$.}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{}
        \textnormal{Operation is \textit{associative} if $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$ for any three elements $a$, $b$ and $c$ in $A$.}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{}
        Element $e \in A$ with the property $e * a = a$ and $a * e = a$ for every element $a \in A$  is called identity element.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{}
        \textnormal{Element $x \in A$ with the property $x * a = e$ and $a * x = e$ for any element $a \in A$ is called inverse of $a$.}
\end{definition}

\section{The Definition of Groups}
A \textbf{group} $\langle G, * \rangle$ is \textit{a set $G$ with an operation $*$} that satisfies the axioms:
\begin{axiom}
$*$ is associative
\end{axiom}
\begin{axiom}
There is an element $e \in G$ such that $a * e = a$ and $e * a = a$ for every element $a \in G$ 
\end{axiom}
\begin{axiom}
There is an element $a^{-1} \in G$ for every element $a \in G$, such that $a * a^{-1} = e$ and $a^{-1} * a = e$ 
\end{axiom}
If group is also commutative we call it \textit{Abelian}. Operation is not necessarily multiplication (addition, modulo addition, boolean operation are some examples).

\section{Elementary Properties of Groups}
There is \textbf{exactly one} identity element $e$ and \textbf{exactly one} inverse element $a{-1}$ in every group.
\begin{theorem}
If $G$ is a group and $a, b, c \in G$ then
\begin{itemize}
\item $ab = ac$ implies $b = c$ and
\item $ba = ca$ implies $b = c$ 
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
If $G$ is a group and $a, b \in G$ then
\begin{itemize}
\item $ab = e$ implies $a = b^{-1}$ and $b = a^{-1}$  
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
If $G$ is a group and $a, b \in G$ then
\begin{itemize}
\item $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$ and
\item $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$  
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
More generaly 
\begin{equation*}
(a_1a_2 \cdots a_n)^{-1} = a_{n}^{-1} \cdots a_{2}^{-1}a_{1}^{-1}
\end{equation*}
If $G$ is finite, number of elements in $G$ is called \textit{order of} $G$ and denoted $|G|$.
Direct product of two groups $G$ and $H$ is new group $G \times H$ defined as follows: $G \times H$ consists of all the ordered pairs $(x, y)$ where $x \in G$ and $y \in H$
\begin{equation*}
   G \times H = \Big\{(x, y): x \in G \text{ and } y \in H\Big\}
\end{equation*}
Let $G$ be a group with $a, b \in G$. For any positive integer $n$, we define $a^n$ by
\begin{equation*}
a^n = \underbrace{aaa \cdots a}_\text{n factors}
\end{equation*}
If $a = z^n$ for some $z \in G$ we say that a has $n$th root in $G$.
\section{Subgroups}
\textbf{Subgroup} $S$ of group $\langle G, * \rangle$ is a nonempty subset of $G$ closed with respect to group $G$ operation and closed with respect to inverses.
\\
Subgroup of $G$ \textit{generated by elements} $a_1, \dots ,a_n$ is a group that contains all possible products of these elements and their inverses.
\\
If subgroup is generated by single element $a \in G$ (\textit{generator}), it is called a \textit{cyclic subgroup of} $G$, designated by $\langle a \rangle$.
\\
Finite groups can be represented using \textit{Cayley diagrams}. There is one point for every element of the group and arrows between points represent the result of multiplying by a generator.
